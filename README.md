# Unexplored Telangana

Unexplored Telangana is a documentation-driven repository dedicated to discovering, documenting, and preserving lesser-known historical, cultural, natural, and spiritual places across Telangana.

This project aims to systematically record places that are historically significant, culturally meaningful, architecturally unique, or geographically interesting — but are not widely documented or promoted.

## Why This Project

Telangana has a rich and layered history — from Satavahanas to Kakatiyas, from Chalukyas to Qutb Shahis — yet many important places remain undocumented or poorly recorded.

This repository aims to:
- Encourage local exploration
- Promote heritage awareness
- Support documentation culture
- Preserve regional knowledge digitally

---

## Current Progress

- Repository initialized
- Started documentation with `temples.md`
- More categories to be added gradually

---

## Future Roadmap

- District-wise categorization
- Map integration references
- Image documentation (with proper attribution)
- Bilingual documentation (English and Telugu)
- Cross-referenced historical timelines
- Contribution guidelines

---

## Contribution Guidelines (Planned)

In future, this repository may allow structured contributions including:

- Verified local history
- Photos with attribution
- GPS coordinates
- Field notes
- Inscription records
- Oral history documentation

All contributions should prioritize accuracy and authenticity.
